      <h1>Let's Learn Machine Learning</h1>
      <p>
        Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that
        enables computers to learn from data and make decisions without explicit
        programming. It is used in applications like recommendation systems,
        self-driving cars, and fraud detection. ML is categorized into
        supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning based on how models
        learn from data. Common algorithms include neural networks, decision
        trees, and support vector machines. With increasing data and computing
        power, ML is transforming industries worldwide.

          Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that
          enables computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions
          without being explicitly programmed. It relies on statistical
          techniques and algorithms to improve decision-making over time.

          There are three main types of ML: supervised learning, where models
          learn from labeled data; unsupervised learning, which identifies
          hidden patterns in unlabeled data; and reinforcement learning, where
          agents learn through rewards and penalties. These approaches help
          solve complex problems in various domains.

          ML is widely used in fields like healthcare, finance, e-commerce, and
          robotics, powering applications such as recommendation systems, fraud
          detection, and self-driving cars. As technology advances, ML continues
          to revolutionize industries, making automation smarter and more
          efficient.
